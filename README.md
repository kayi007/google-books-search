# How to user Google Books Search
It's pretty simple to use, here's what the app has:
- Search Page: 
Enter the title of the Book or author of the book to begin your search. If you found the book you're looking for, just simply click the **SAVE** button to save for later. 
- Saved Page: Contains all the saved books you're interested. If you're no longer interested or finished reading the book, you can simply remoove the book with a click of the **DELETE** button on the side.
